# CS559 P3 - Mini Golf Game

A 3D mini-golf game built with THREE.js and custom physics.

## Current Status

## Features (Planned)

- Custom physics system (no Cannon.js)
- Mouse/touch controls with wobble aiming mechanic
- Power-up system with manual activation
- Multiple holes with increasing difficulty
- Prototype and Full modes
- Visual effects and animations

## Running the Game

Open `index.html` in a web browser. For best results, use a local web server:

```bash
# Using Python
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (http-server)
npx http-server

# Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```
